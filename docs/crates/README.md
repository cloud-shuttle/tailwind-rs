## üöÄ Getting Started

Each crate can be used independently or as part of the complete tailwind-rs ecosystem:

```rust
// Core functionality
use tailwind_rs_core::{ClassBuilder, TailwindBuilder};

// Framework integration
use tailwind_rs_leptos::LeptosTailwindBuilder;
use tailwind_rs_yew::YewTailwindBuilder;

// CLI tooling
tailwind-rs-cli build --watch

// PostCSS integration
use tailwind_rs_postcss::PostCSSProcessor;
```

The modular design allows teams to adopt only the components they need while maintaining the ability to expand functionality as requirements grow.
