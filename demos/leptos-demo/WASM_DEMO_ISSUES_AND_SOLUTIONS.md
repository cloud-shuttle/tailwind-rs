# WASM Demo Issues and Solutions

## Overview

This document outlines the challenges encountered while building a Leptos WASM demo for the Tailwind-RS project and provides comprehensive solutions.

## Issues Encountered

### 1. Dependency Conflicts with WASM Target

#### Problem
The main issue preventing successful WASM compilation is the inclusion of dependencies that don't support the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target:

- **`mio` crate**: Explicitly states "This wasm target is unsupported by mio"
- **`tokio` crate**: Pulls in `mio` as a dependency
- **`uuid` crate**: Has WASM compatibility issues with certain features
- **`chrono` crate**: Can cause issues with WASM when using certain features

#### Root Cause Analysis
```bash
# Dependency tree shows the problematic chain:
tailwind-rs-core -> tokio -> mio (WASM incompatible)
tailwind-rs-leptos -> tokio -> mio (WASM incompatible)
```

### 2. Leptos Version Compatibility

#### Problem
- Leptos v0.8.8 API changes from v0.8.5
- Signal API changes: `create_signal` → `signal`
- Signal access changes: `signal()` → `signal.get()`
- Import path changes for various traits and functions

#### API Changes
```rust
// Old (v0.8.5)
let (count, set_count) = create_signal(0);
let value = count();

// New (v0.8.8)
let (count, set_count) = signal(0);
let value = count.get();
```

### 3. Import Path Issues

#### Problem
Leptos v0.8.8 has reorganized import paths:
- `leptos::html::ClassAttribute` → `leptos::attr::global::ClassAttribute`
- Various other trait imports moved to different modules

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Minimal WASM-Compatible Demo

#### Approach
Create a simplified demo that doesn't depend on the full `tailwind-rs-core` library, avoiding problematic dependencies.

#### Implementation
```rust
// Simple class builder for demo purposes
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct ClassBuilder {
    classes: Vec<String>,
}

impl ClassBuilder {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self { classes: Vec::new() }
    }
    
    pub fn class(mut self, class: &str) -> Self {
        self.classes.push(class.to_string());
        self
    }
    
    pub fn build(self) -> String {
        self.classes.join(" ")
    }
}
```

#### Benefits
- ✅ No WASM compatibility issues
- ✅ Fast compilation
- ✅ Small bundle size
- ✅ Demonstrates core concepts

#### Limitations
- ❌ Doesn't showcase full Tailwind-RS capabilities
- ❌ Limited to basic class concatenation
- ❌ No advanced features like validation or optimization

### Solution 2: WASM-Compatible Tailwind-RS Core

#### Approach
Modify the `tailwind-rs-core` crate to be WASM-compatible by:

1. **Conditional compilation** for WASM targets
2. **Feature flags** to disable problematic dependencies
3. **Alternative implementations** for WASM

#### Implementation Strategy

##### 1. Feature Flags in Cargo.toml
```toml
[features]
default = ["full"]
full = ["tokio", "chrono", "uuid"]
wasm = ["wasm-compat"]
wasm-compat = []

[dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1.0", optional = true }
chrono = { version = "0.4", optional = true, features = ["wasm-bindgen"] }
uuid = { version = "1.0", optional = true, features = ["wasm-bindgen"] }
```

##### 2. Conditional Code
```rust
#[cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))]
use tokio::runtime::Runtime;

#[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]
use wasm_compat::Runtime;

#[cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))]
fn create_runtime() -> Runtime {
    Runtime::new().unwrap()
}

#[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]
fn create_runtime() -> Runtime {
    Runtime::wasm_compatible()
}
```

##### 3. WASM-Compatible Alternatives
```rust
// For time handling
#[cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))]
use chrono::{DateTime, Utc};

#[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]
use js_sys::Date as WasmDate;

// For UUID generation
#[cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))]
use uuid::Uuid;

#[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

#[wasm_bindgen]
extern "C" {
    #[wasm_bindgen(js_namespace = crypto)]
    fn randomUUID() -> String;
}
```

### Solution 3: Separate WASM Crate

#### Approach
Create a dedicated WASM-compatible crate that provides a subset of Tailwind-RS functionality.

#### Structure
```
crates/
├── tailwind-rs-core/          # Full-featured core
├── tailwind-rs-wasm/          # WASM-compatible subset
└── tailwind-rs-leptos-wasm/   # Leptos integration for WASM
```

#### Benefits
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns
- ✅ Optimized for WASM performance
- ✅ No compromise on full-featured core
- ✅ Easier maintenance

### Solution 4: Build System Integration

#### Approach
Integrate WASM build process with the existing build system to handle dependencies automatically.

#### Implementation
```toml
# Cargo.toml for demo
[dependencies]
tailwind-rs-core = { path = "../../crates/tailwind-rs-core", features = ["wasm"] }
leptos = { version = "0.8.8", features = ["csr"] }

[target.'cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")'.dependencies]
# WASM-specific dependencies
wasm-bindgen = "0.2"
web-sys = "0.3"
```

## Recommended Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Quick Fix (Current)
- ✅ Create minimal demo with custom ClassBuilder
- ✅ Use Leptos v0.8.8 with correct API
- ✅ Focus on core functionality demonstration

### Phase 2: WASM-Compatible Core
- [ ] Add feature flags to `tailwind-rs-core`
- [ ] Implement conditional compilation
- [ ] Create WASM-compatible alternatives for problematic dependencies
- [ ] Add comprehensive testing for WASM target

### Phase 3: Full Integration
- [ ] Update demo to use full `tailwind-rs-core` with WASM features
- [ ] Add advanced Tailwind-RS features to demo
- [ ] Implement performance optimizations
- [ ] Add comprehensive Playwright tests

### Phase 4: Production Ready
- [ ] Optimize bundle size
- [ ] Add tree-shaking support
- [ ] Implement caching strategies
- [ ] Add monitoring and analytics

## Testing Strategy

### WASM Compatibility Testing
```bash
# Test WASM compilation
cargo check --target wasm32-unknown-unknown

# Test WASM build
wasm-pack build --target web --out-dir pkg

# Test in browser
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

### Playwright Testing
```bash
# Install Playwright
npm install @playwright/test

# Run tests
npm run test
npm run test:wasm
```

## Performance Considerations

### Bundle Size Optimization
- Use `wasm-opt` for optimization
- Implement tree-shaking
- Lazy load non-critical features
- Use compression (gzip/brotli)

### Runtime Performance
- Minimize allocations
- Use efficient string operations
- Implement caching for class generation
- Optimize for mobile devices

## Security Considerations

### WASM Security
- Validate all inputs
- Sanitize class names
- Prevent XSS attacks
- Use Content Security Policy

### Dependency Security
- Regular dependency updates
- Security audit tools
- Minimal dependency footprint
- Trusted crate sources

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Development Tools
- Browser DevTools integration
- WASM debugging support
- Performance profiling
- Error tracking

### Production Monitoring
- Bundle size tracking
- Performance metrics
- Error reporting
- User analytics

## Conclusion

The WASM demo implementation requires careful handling of dependencies and API compatibility. The recommended approach is to:

1. **Start with a minimal demo** to establish working foundation
2. **Gradually add WASM compatibility** to the core library
3. **Implement comprehensive testing** for both native and WASM targets
4. **Optimize for production** with performance and security considerations

This phased approach ensures we can deliver a working demo quickly while building toward a robust, production-ready WASM implementation of Tailwind-RS.

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Fix the current demo with Leptos v0.8.8 API
2. **Short-term**: Implement WASM-compatible core library
3. **Medium-term**: Add comprehensive testing and optimization
4. **Long-term**: Production deployment and monitoring
